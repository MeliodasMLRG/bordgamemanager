# Boardgame Manager

This project is a simple website that displays various games in a visually appealing manner. Each game is represented by an HTML file and has an associated image. The website features a dark color scheme and centers the game boxes for a clean layout.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main entry point of the website that links to the CSS for styling and displays the game boxes.
- **games/**: A directory containing HTML files for each game:
  - `game1.html`
  - `game2.html`
  - `game3.html`
- **images/**: A directory containing images corresponding to each game:
  - `game1.jpg`
  - `game2.jpg`
  - `game3.jpg`
- **css/styles.css**: The stylesheet that defines the dark color scheme and styles for the game boxes.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the website.
3. Ensure that the images and game HTML files are in their respective directories for proper display.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the HTML files in the `games/` directory or update the images in the `images/` directory to add new games or change existing ones. You can also customize the styles in `css/styles.css` to fit your design preferences.
